Create a user account on any MYSQL server with a specified username and password which will later be used by your Express.js app
Grant full privileges to this user account to create any database and table 


CREATE USER 'basicuser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password'; 
GRANT ALL ON *.* TO 'basicuser'@'%';


Check that the user account has been created successfully with:

SELECT user FROM mysql.user;

Now run the following commands to create a database and table, populate it with content and perform some basic queries on it:

CREATE DATABASE workshopdb;

SHOW DATABASES;

USE workshopdb;

SELECT DATABASE();

CREATE TABLE employees(
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT NULL,
  country VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT NULL,
	age INT DEFAULT NULL,
	salary FLOAT DEFAULT NULL 
);

SHOW TABLES;


INSERT INTO employees(name, country, age, salary) 
VALUES 
  ('Peter', 'Malaysia', 35, 2700.16),
  ('James', 'Singapore', 22, 3200.22),
  ('Ali', 'Indonesia', 27, 5400.00),
  ('Sally', 'Thailand', 60, 10200.20),
  ('Muthu', 'Malaysia', 44, 8200.30),
  ('Emma', 'Singapore', 52, 9500.00),
  ('Sophia', 'Thailand', 30, 15800.10);
  
SELECT * FROM employees;

SELECT id, name, age FROM employees;

SELECT id, country, salary FROM employees;

SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY age;

SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary desc;

SELECT * FROM employees WHERE age > 40;

SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary < 9000;

SELECT * FROM employees WHERE country = 'Malaysia';

SELECT * FROM employees WHERE id = 1;

UPDATE employees 
SET name = 'Spiderman', age = 22, country = 'USA' 
WHERE id = 1;

SELECT * FROM employees WHERE id = 1;

DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = 3;

SELECT * FROM employees;

DROP TABLE employees;

DROP DATABASE workshopdb;
